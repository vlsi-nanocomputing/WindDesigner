## WindDesigner
WindDesigner is a Matlab-based tool developed with the aim of evaluating the global efficiency of a wind generator, according to
the variation of wind speed. Two ideas are at the base of this tool. First, given a particular site with an average wind speeds
distribution, to evaluate which structure the generator should have to maximize the energy harvested. Second, given a fixed
generator composition and an average wind speeds distribution, to evaluate the best control solution to adopt with the aim
of maximizing the energy generated.
